1. univariate analysis
    1.1 categorical analysis
        1.1.1 Heat/hot water, Noise-residential, illegal parking were the biggest issues for the jan 2025 out of all issues covering 50-55% of issues
        1.1.2 NYPD(New York City Police Department) and HPD (New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development) handles nearly 80% of the issues. 
                we will dig deeper into this which agency is most inefficient or overloaded (maybe have less resources to handles issues)
        1.1.3 93% cases are closed. We will investigate this later.

    1.2 Temporal analysis
        1.2.1 Former half of the month had average 12k requests per day and the later half of the month had average around 8k per day
        1.2.2 heatmap shows a massive concentration of activity between 8:00 AM and 4:00 PM on Weekdays expacially on Monday and tuesday.
        1.2.3 The histogram shows a massive spike at < 5 hours. 
                This is incredibly fast for government services. It implies one of two things:
                High Efficiency:  They are actually fixing potholes/lights instantly.
                Automated Closures:  Many tickets might be "Closed - No Violation Found" or auto-closed by systems immediately.

    1.3 Spatial analysis
        1.3.1 The point map confirms high data precision. We observe clear "dead zones" corresponding to non-residential areas (Central Park, Airports, Cemeteries). This confirms the GPS data is accurate enough for block-level resource routing.
